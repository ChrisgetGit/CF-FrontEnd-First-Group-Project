            Star-Lord is a master strategist and problem solver who is an expert
            in close-quarter combat, various human and alien firearms, and
            battle techniques. He has extensive knowledge of various alien
            customs, societies, and cultures, and considerable knowledge about
            cosmic abstracts

            As Star-Lord, Peter Quill wears a suit that grants augmented
            strength and durability and the ability to travel through space. The
            character uses an "Element Gun", a special meta-pistol capable of
            projecting one of the four elements (air, earth, fire and water).
            Star-Lord shares a psychic link with his sentient space vessel,
            Ship.
          </p>
          <!--           <p class="theme-font mb1">
            Ship is a sentient energy form. She most often exists in the form of
            a starship but can alter her structure at will. She can travel
            through air, space and water. She possesses many of the conventional
            starship accessories, including shields, energy blasters, advanced
            sensors, replicators (able to form any kind of food, drink, etc.),
            and hologram projectors. She has proven capable of creating a human
            form, which she can then animate and use as a host. Even if
            completely destroyed, she is capable of restoring herself, since her
            true form is her consciousness. In addition, she takes on a number
            of feminine characteristics, such as a mothering instinct for those
            she is partnered with. She has felt deeper attachments, including
            love for her partners.

          <h4 class="theme-font mb1">Short biography</h4>
          <p class="theme-font mb1">
            When J'son's ship crash lands in Colorado, he is taken in by
            Meredith Quill. The two form a relationship while J'son makes
            repairs to his ship. Eventually, J'son is forced to leave to return
            home and fight in a war. He leaves, not knowing Meredith is pregnant
            with Peter Quill. Ten years later, Meredith is killed when she is
            attacked by two Badoon soldiers who have come to kill Peter and end
            J'son's blood line. Peter finds his father's gun by accident, kills
            them with a shotgun, and escapes his home before it is destroyed by
            the Badoon ship. The Badoon presume Peter has been killed and leave.
            Peter is placed in an orphanage and eventually joins NASA. It was
            eventually explained that he was raised by his mother's best friend
            Lisa Chang who was a commander at NASA
