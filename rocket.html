            Rocket Raccoon resurfaced as a member of the team chosen to
            accompany Star-Lord on his mission to stop a Phalanx infiltration of
            the Kree homeworld. Rocket is depicted as a gifted military
            tactician who is fearless, loyal, and insightful. It is heavily
            implied that he has a case of obsessive compulsive disorder.
            Rocket's trademark rocket skates are absent.

            Rocket Raccoon possesses the normal attributes of an Earth raccoon,
            including speed (which has been additionally amplified by his
            training), and an acute sense of smell, sight, hearing and touch.
            Sharp claws allow him to scale walls, buildings, and trees with
            ease. He is an accomplished starship pilot, a brilliant engineer and
            technician, and an expert marksman with the two laser pistols he
            carries as well as having an affinity for heavy weapons. He is a
            master military tactician and leader, attributes that help him take
            charge of the Guardians of the Galaxy when Star-Lord is unavailable.

          <h4 class="theme-font mb1">Short biography</h4>
          <p class="theme-font mb1">
            Rocket Raccoon acts as the "Guardian of the Keystone Quadrant", an
            area of outer space sealed off from the rest of the cosmos by the
            so-called Galacian Wall. Rocket is captain of the starship Rack 'n'
            Ruin, and he and his first mate Wal Rus (a talking walrus) come from
            the planet Halfworld in the Keystone Quadrant, an abandoned colony
            for the mentally ill where the animal companions were genetically
            manipulated to grant them human level intelligence and bipedal body
            construction for many to become caretakers of the inmates. Rocket
            was Halfworld's chief law officer ("ranger") who protected the
            colony against various threats
