            Groot is an extraterrestrial tree monster who initially came to
            Earth seeking humans to capture and study. Groot was seemingly
            destroyed by termites.
          </p>
          <p class="theme-font mb1">
            Xemnu made a duplicate of Groot by making a human and tree hybrid
            that was used to fight the Hulk, but it was destroyed in the battle.
          </p>
          <!--           <p class="theme-font mb1">
            As a consequence of the battle, Groot dies, buying the team some
            time to escape. A new Groot was created as a sprig offshoot and went
            on to accompany the team on their continued mission against the
            Phalanx, but was one of the team members captured by the Phalanx.
            Groot and the others were freed by Mantis, and escaped back to the
            lines of the Kree's resistance. In time, Groot's body regenerated
            from the twig, growing back to full size. Groot and the others
            intended to carry on as part of Star-Lord's team.
          </p> -->
          <p class="theme-font mb1">
            Whenever Groot is saying the trademark "I am Groot!" he has actually
            been saying a number of things, and his varying inflections of the
            sentence are the equivalent of words and sentences. People who have
            interacted with Groot are gradually able to decipher the meaning of
            the inflections and can carry on full conversations with Groot as
            time goes on. The mature form of Groot's species is robust and
            heavyweight, which causes the organs of acoustic generation to
            become stiff and inflexible. It is this nature of Groot's larynx
            that causes people, who are oblivious to the subtle nuances of Flora
            Colossi speech, to misinterpret Groot as merely repeating his name.

              Groot can control trees and plants, using them to attack others,

              Groot has been seemingly killed on multiple occasions, each time
              regrowing from a sprig.
