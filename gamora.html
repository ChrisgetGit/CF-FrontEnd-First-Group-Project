            Gamora received treatments from Thanos that enhanced her speed,
            strength, agility, and durability to rival Adam Warlock's (to better
            slay the Magus, his evil, future self). Thanos also helped her
            become a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, trained in the
            martial-arts techniques from various planets, in the uses of the
            known weaponry of the Milky Way galaxy, and stealth techniques. She
            is also a highly skilled gymnast and assassin, and formerly
            possessed a telepathic link to Thanos. She uses a wide variety of
            weaponry, most notably a dagger whose unknown properties made it
            capable of slaying even beings of such immense power as Thanos and
            the Magus

            Gamora is one of the most skilled martial artists in the Marvel
            Universe, being cybernetically enhanced to have superhuman strength,
            speed, and a rapid-healing ability.. She is capable of defeating
            opponents who possess superhuman strength and durability that far
            surpass her own, and she has defeated a military platoon containing
            dozens of combat-trained men in only a few minutes. She has learned
            to paralyze or kill opponents using vital-point strikes directed at
            certain nerve clusters. Although skilled in the use of most
            conventional weapons, she prefers to use knives and swords.

          <h4 class="theme-font mb1">Life biography</h4>
          <p class="theme-font mb1">
            Gamora is the last of her species, the Zen-Whoberis, who were
            exterminated by the Badoon (in her original timeline, her species
            was exterminated by the Universal Church of Truth). Thanos found her
            as a child and decided to use her as a weapon. Gamora was raised and
            trained by Thanos to assassinate the Magus, the evil, future version
            of Adam Warlock. Thanos showed her little kindness during her
            childhood, but Gamora was very loyal to the man who promised her the
            opportunity to avenge the death of her family. Gamora became very
            proficient in martial arts, earning the nickname "The deadliest
            woman in the whole galaxy". When she was a teenager, Thanos took her
            on a trip to Tartoonla #7. Gamora disobeyed Thanos's orders, and due
            to this, came into conflict with a group of thugs. She was greatly
            outnumbered, and despite her skills, she was defeated and then raped
            by the assailants. Thanos found her half dead, and in turn, murdered
            all of her assailants and restored her to health, cybernetically
            enhancing her to superhuman levels.
